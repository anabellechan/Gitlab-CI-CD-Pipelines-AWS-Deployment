# DevOps with GitLab CI - Pipelines and AWS Deployment

First, unpack the src-files zip folder. It contains the static html to build the website using the pipelines and deploy them to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS, as well as using S3 Bucket.

It also includes writing a Dockerfile to build and deploy the container from a specified base image, configuring the container environment, defining any necessary dependencies, and specifying the commands to run when the container starts. Additionally, the Dockerfile includes instructions for copying application code and configuration files into the container, setting environment variables, exposing ports, and any other necessary configuration steps. Once the Dockerfile is written, it can be used in conjunction with Docker build commands to create a Docker image that encapsulates the application and its dependencies, which can then be deployed to the production environment using the specified deployment process.
